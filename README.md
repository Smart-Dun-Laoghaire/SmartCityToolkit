Where to find the Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smartcity-toolkit

  Motivation:

This project aims to simulate smart city technologies within the Minecraft environment. By integrating sensors and real-world data, the mod serves as an educational tool to demonstrate how smart cities function and how different environmental factors can be monitored and managed using technology.

  How to Install:

Download the mod from the releases page. (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smartcity-toolkit)
Ensure you have the correct version of Minecraft and Forge:
Minecraft version: 1.19.x
Forge version: 50.1
Move the downloaded .jar file into your Minecraft mods folder.
Launch Minecraft and ensure the mod is active in the Mods menu.

  Methodology:

The mod uses particle effects to visually represent air quality levels. Particles change color and density based on real-time data, providing an intuitive way to understand the air quality in different parts of the simulated smart city.

The mod also uses different weather conditions based on real-time data. For example, when the weather sensor displays as raining, the in-game environment showcases rain.  

  Introduce Myself:

Hello! Iâ€™m Nikita Kamat, a passionate developer with experience in game design and cognitive science. I developed this mod as part of a project aimed at demonstrating smart city technologies in an interactive and engaging way.

  Future Work:

Add colorful array of blocks to make the sensor clearly displayable on the map.
Create visual cue depending on the temperature sensor.
Expand Sensor Types: Include additional sensors such as wind direction and humidity.
Data Visualization: Integrate more advanced data visualization techniques to display sensor data.
Real-Time Integration: Further enhance the real-time integration with external data sources for a more dynamic environment.
