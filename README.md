### Motivation:

This project aims to simulate smart city technologies within the Minecraft environment. By integrating sensors and real-world data, the mod serves as an educational tool to demonstrate how smart cities function and how different environmental factors can be monitored and managed using technology.

### How to Install:

1. Download the mod from the [releases page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smartcity-toolkit).
2. Ensure you have the correct version of Minecraft and Forge:
   - Minecraft version: 1.19.x
   - Forge version: 50.1
3. Move the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.
4. Launch Minecraft and ensure the mod is active in the Mods menu.

### Methodology:

The mod uses particle effects to visually represent air quality levels. Particles change color and density based on real-time data, providing an intuitive way to understand the air quality in different parts of the simulated smart city.

The mod also uses different weather conditions based on real-time data. For example, the in-game environment showcases rain when the weather sensor displays rain.

### Introduce Myself:

Hello! I’m Nikita Kamat, a passionate developer with experience in game design and cognitive science. I developed this mod as part of a project aimed at demonstrating smart city technologies interactively and engagingly.

### Future Work:

- Add a colorful array of blocks to make the sensor displayable on the map.
- Create visual cues depending on the temperature sensor.
- Expand Sensor Types: Include additional sensors such as wind direction and humidity.
- Data Visualization: Integrate more advanced data visualization techniques to display sensor data.
- Real-Time Integration: Further enhance the real-time integration with external data sources for a more dynamic environment.
